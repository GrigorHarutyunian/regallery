    title: "Beautiful Gallery!",
    text: `As the demo shows, it’s a beautiful gallery and looks just as good on our own sites. Has no impact on loading time, has the most gorgeous lightbox thumbnail transition/graphics of all the galleries I’ve seen. Uses a great lightbox with a plethora of options. The image sourcing is excellent, most gallery plugin’s often source from bigger images taking a lot more bandwidth; ReGallery uses just the right sources. It’s responsive and plays very well. ReGallery comes highly recommended!`,

    title: "BEST Gallery Plugin",
    text: `I am quite pleased with this plugin, and have used it on a few sites. I find it easy to use, and the galleries look great on all screen sizes. After creating several gallery pages, I was having difficulty pinpointing why a NEW gallery page wasn’t working. Support was quick and efficient – they explained what was causing the issue, and shared how to fix it. I am grateful for the plugin and the assistance!`,

    title: "WOW!",
    text: `I looked for (2) days straight for a gallery plugin that was not heinous after realizing that loading all my images onto a page was not ideal. And after countless installs, tutorials and research e.g. reddit, search engines; I discovered the Five out of 5⁵. It does not get easier or better than this (for me). Thank you.`,
